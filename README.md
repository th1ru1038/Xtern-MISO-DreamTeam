## How to Run

### Development Mode (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the client folder:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to the URL shown (typically http://localhost:5173)

### Alternative: Build and Serve (if Node version < 22.12)

If you have an older Node.js version, you can build and serve the static files:

1. Navigate to the client folder:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the production files:

   npm run build
   ```

4. Serve the built files using Python:

   ```bash
   cd dist
   python -m http.server 8080
   ```

5. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

## Data Sources

The dashboard loads data from `public/data/vector_data.json`, which is generated by running `process_data.py` in the root directory.

To update the data:

```bash
python process_data.py
```

This processes the real CSV data from:

- `MISO/money_vector/final_output/`
- `project_canary/analysis/data/`
